## About
Star Trek, for me, is an enormous part of my life. A part that brings an incredible amount of happiness. Star Trek is, though, an incredibly large franchise and, for some, hard to get into. Which is what led me to the decision to build this site.

This website will serve to not only share my favorite parts about Star Trek, but will also help newcomers with their first steps into the world of being a Trekkie. Whether watching the movies or TV shows, or collecting the cards, or even just playing the games, this site will guide you to what I feel is the very best Star Trek Has to offer.
