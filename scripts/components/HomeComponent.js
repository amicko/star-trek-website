						Welcome to Memory Alpha, a fan site designed to help newcomers to the Star Trek universe. This site is designed with all fans in mind, but with an eye for the newest.
					</p>
					<p>
						To me, Star Trek is the goal post that humanity can set for itself. In the world portrayed there, we see a humanity without greed, or poverty. A future full of hope, and wonderful technological achievements as far as the eye can see. Star Trek is in many ways the utopia we can all aspire to, where every person strives to better themselves for the sake of their own improvement and the improvement of mankind as a whole. It is incredible, and I hope you will find your time here helpful in exploring the world of Star Trek for yourself.

					<h2>Personal History</h2>
					<p>
						My own personal experience with Star Trek started when I was just a little kid. My grandfather introduced me to the Original Series of Star Trek and guided me through each successive series. His bedroom was a treasure trove of Star Trek memorabilia, and it was always so exciting to explore his walls and bookshelves which were all covered with everything from autographed images, to models, to action figurines and prop replicas.
					</p>

						Star Trek is actually what initially got me interested in programming. My early online excursions introduced me to the world of chatting, and I found an incredible sci-fi chatroom community by the name of Outpost Ten Forward. Among many of the sites mechanics and features included the ability to access basic programming abilities in the chat itself. I loved that site and wanted to help contribute to it's further success, which is what led me to my early education in programming.
